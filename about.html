              THE BRAND
            </h3>
            ALEXACHUNG is a fashion brand named after its human Founder and
            Creative Director, Alexa Chung. Born in London in 2017 (the brand,
            not the human), company make clothes that reflect the iconic and
            discernibly British style of Alexa Chung (the human). <br />With
            over a decade's experience in collaborating with fashion brands, and
            with the idea of starting her own label warmly incubating in her
            mind for some time, Alexa decided to take the plunge and launch her
            namesake ALEXACHUNG in London.<br />
            At the heart of the brand, Alexa's vision is to
            <i>create clothes that people want to wear</i>. Drawing inspiration
            from the world of music and vintage style, ALEXACHUNG injects an
            inherent British irreverence and wit into its collections. It is
            inspired by everything, from Jane Birkin's insouciance, to David
            Hockney's stripy sweater. ALEXACHUNG prides itself on its unique
            approach to making clothes, combining distinctive fabrics and prints
            with classic tailoring. The result is a carefully considered,
            alluring combination of prim, racy and rock 'n' roll, where
            frivolous party pieces interact with grown-up tailoring and classic
            silhouettes.
